What have you completed since the last report?
I worked with both client teams in class to hook up our API to their applications.  I also updated the parameters on a couple of our API methods, so the API could process requests without tags.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?
I plan to continue to work with the Web and Mobile client teams to answer any questions they have regarding the API so they are successful in their implementations.  I also plan to help my team finish the documentation and complete our API web test page.

What is getting in your way?
There is nothing getting in my way of completing my portion of the project.
